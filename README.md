**Abstract**
This study aims to identify predominant factors influencing the severity of road traffic accidents in the United States using multinominal logistic regression. Feature engineering is employed to create new features from existing features, find unnecessary features for deletion, and conduct a log coefficient feature selection using ordinal logistic regression. Bump, Stop, Precipitation, Traffic Calming and Crossing are found to play pivotal roles in determining the severity levels. This paper hopes to contribute to the nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between various factors and the accident outcomes, as well as improvement in road safety.
